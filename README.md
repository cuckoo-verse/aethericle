## 📖 Introduction

Aethericle is a reader and editor for visual novels within the Cuckoo Verse, aiming to provide a reading experience that combines modern design with cultural ambiance. Inspired by Spotify, it strives to create a more user-friendly interface. The project is primarily developed using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) frameworks, meaning it can function both as a client application and run on the web.

Aethericle draws inspiration from [*Shenzhou Broken-Sword Legend*](https://webstatic.mihoyo.com/bh3/event/novel-7swords/index.html#/), a work that played a key role in the inception of this project. Based on its original content, this project optimizes the data structure and uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database for a better development experience.
